# Experimenting with multi-task learning for mobile robot perception in warehouses.
## Still under development

Goals: Test multiple algorithms (from heavy models to lighter modules able to run on an edge device) and assess the performance on multiple tasks (starting with depth estimation, object detection, segmentation and potentially normals --- as normals seem to benefit most other tasks when trained together) 

2 different datasets will be used (NNdataset: consisting of real-world annotated images in a produciton facility; and WarehouseSim: Simulated data collected using NVIDIA Isaac Sim platform and focusing on warehouse environments)
